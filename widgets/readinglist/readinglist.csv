Ghosh, Federico De Martino","Mapping the human subcortical auditory system using histology, post mortem MRI and in vivo MRI at 7T",BioRxiv,2019,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/568139v1.full,"Studying the human subcortical auditory system non-invasively is challenging due to its small structures deep within the brain. Additionally, the elaborate three-dimensional (3-D) structure of the system can be difficult to understand based on currently available 2-D schematics and animal models. To address these issues, we measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) responses from the human subcortical auditory system at 7 Tesla and validated the results by creating an atlas based on state of the art human histology (BigBrain) and post mortem MRI. Furthermore, using diffusion MRI tractography, we revealed structural connectivity maps of the human subcortical auditory pathway both in vivo (1050 µm isotropic resolution) and post mortem (200 µm isotropic resolution). This work contributes novel tools for researching the human auditory system to understand its structural organization as well as facilitates dissemination of this knowledge by making the created atlases openly available"

However, automatic segmentation of the MTL using only T1‐weighted (T1w) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is challenging due to the large anatomical variability of the MTL cortex and the confound of the dura mater, which is commonly segmented as gray matter by state‐of‐the‐art algorithms because they have similar intensity in T1w MRI. To address these challenges, we developed a novel atlas set, consisting of 15 cognitively normal older adults and 14 patients with mild cognitive impairment with a label explicitly assigned to the dura, that can be used by the multiatlas automated pipeline (Automatic Segmentation of Hippocampal Subfields [ASHS‐T1]) for the segmentation of MTL subregions, including anterior/posterior hippocampus, entorhinal cortex (ERC), Brodmann areas (BA) 35 and 36, and parahippocampal cortex on T1w MRI. Cross‐validation experiments indicated good segmentation accuracy of ASHS‐T1 and that the dura can be reliably separated from the cortex (6.5% mislabeled as gray matter). Conversely, FreeSurfer segmented majority of the dura mater (62.4%) as gray matter and the degree of dura mislabeling decreased with increasing disease severity. To evaluate its clinical utility, we applied the pipeline to T1w images of 663 ADNI subjects and significant volume/thickness loss is observed in BA35, ERC, and posterior hippocampus in early prodromal AD and all subregions at later stages. As such, the publicly available new atlas and ASHS‐T1 could have important utility in the early diagnosis and monitoring of AD and enhancing brain‐behavior studies of these regions."

Bernhardt",Anatomical and microstructural determinants of hippocampal subfield functional connectome embedding,PNAS,2018,https://www.pnas.org/content/115/40/10154,"The hippocampus plays key roles in cognition and affect and serves as a model system for structure/function studies in animals. So far, its complex anatomy has challenged investigations targeting its substructural organization in humans. State-of-the-art MRI offers the resolution and versatility to identify hippocampal subfields, assess its microstructure, and study topographical principles of its connectivity in vivo. We developed an approach to unfold the human hippocampus and examine spatial variations of intrinsic functional connectivity in a large cohort of healthy adults. In addition to mapping common and unique connections across subfields, we identified two main axes of subregional connectivity transitions. An anterior/posterior gradient followed long-axis landmarks and metaanalytical findings from task-based functional MRI, while a medial/lateral gradient followed hippocampal infolding and correlated with proxies of cortical myelin. Findings were consistent in an independent sample and highly stable across resting-state scans. Our results provide robust evidence for long-axis specialization in the resting human hippocampus and suggest an intriguing interplay between connectivity and microstructure."
Luo et al.,"Zhiguo Luo, Ling-Li Zeng, Jian Qin, Chenping Hou, Hui Shen, Dewen Hu",Functional Parcellation of Human Brain Precuneus Using Density-Based Clustering,Cerebral Cortex,2019,https://academic.oup.com/cercor/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1093/cercor/bhz086/5482328,"The human precuneus is involved in many high-level cognitive functions, which strongly suggests the existence of biologically meaningful subdivisions. However, the functional parcellation of the precuneus needs much to be investigated. In this study, we developed an eigen clustering (EIC) approach for the parcellation using precuneus–cortical functional connectivity from fMRI data of the Human Connectome Project. The EIC approach is robust to noise and can automatically determine the cluster number. It is consistently demonstrated that the human precuneus can be subdivided into six symmetrical and connected parcels. The anterior and posterior precuneus participate in sensorimotor and visual functions, respectively. The central precuneus with four subregions indicates a media role in the interaction of the default mode, dorsal attention, and frontoparietal control networks. The EIC-based functional parcellation is free of the spatial distance constraint and is more functionally coherent than parcellation using typical clustering algorithms. The precuneus subregions had high accordance with cortical morphology and revealed good functional segregation and integration characteristics in functional task-evoked activations. This study may shed new light on the human precuneus function at a delicate level and offer an alternative scheme for human brain parcellation."

Schrader, Andrea Bernasconi, Neda Bernasconi, R. Nathan Spreng, Boris C. Bernhardt",Target Age-related Differences in Brain and Cognition with Multimodal Imaging and Connectome Topography Profiling,BioRxiv,2019,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/601146v1,"Aging is characterised by accumulation of structural and metabolic changes in the brain. Recent studies suggest transmodal brain networks are especially sensitive to aging, which, we hypothesise, may be due to their apical position in the cortical hierarchy. Studying an open-access healthy cohort (n=102, age range = 30-89 years) with MRI and Aβ PET data, we estimated age-related cortical thinning, hippocampal atrophy and Aβ deposition. In addition to carrying out surface-based morphological and metabolic mapping, we stratified effects along neocortical and hippocampal resting-state functional connectome gradients derived from independent datasets. The cortical gradient depicts an axis of functional differentiation from sensory-motor regions to transmodal regions, whereas the hippocampal gradient recapitulates its long-axis. While age-related thinning and increased Aβ deposition occurred across the entire cortical topography, increased Aβ deposition was especially pronounced towards higher-order transmodal regions. Age-related atrophy was greater towards the posterior end of the hippocampal long-axis. No significant effect of age on Aβ deposition in the hippocampus was observed. Imaging markers correlated with behavioural measures of fluid intelligence and episodic memory in a topography-specific manner. Our results strengthen existing evidence of structural and metabolic change in the aging brain and support the use of connectivity gradients as a compact framework to analyse and conceptualize brain-based biomarkers of aging."
