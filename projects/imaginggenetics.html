<span style="font-size: large; font-weight: bold">Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus</span><br>
<br>Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disease that gradually
develops through progressive impairment of glucose metabolism. It is induced
through a combination of environmental and genetic risk factors. Elevated
fasting glucose levels, hypertension, obesity and/or dyslipidemia &#8212; also
known as the 'metabolic syndrome (MetS)' &#8212; are commonly observed
environmental risk factors in subjects at risk to develop T2DM. However, the
complex genetic nature remains largely unknown. Eventually, T2DM may lead to
damage of many organs, including the cardiovascular and/or central nervous
systems. In this project, I focus on the genetical and neuroradiological
differences in subjects affected by T2DM (N=44) and MetS (N=44), compared to
controls (N=45), using whole-exome sequencing and 7T MRI, respectively.<br>

<span style="font-weight: bold">&#8212; Hippocampal correlates of memory impairment in T2DM</span><br>
<br>Memory problems are frequently observed with T2DM, however, the structural and
functional brain changes, measured using MRI, remain poorly understood,
specifically with respect to the hippocampal formation (HF), a complex brain
structure that plays an important role in memory functioning. Insufficient
spatial resolution in typical clinical scans and a lack of tailored analysis
methods have hampered progress in elucidating these hippocampal changes at the
substructural level. In this project, we will use the 7T MRI dataset, behavioral
data, and a novel analysis method to study changes in the HF associated with
T2DM at a finer scale than previously possible. Given the high prevalence of
T2DM, the results will provide important and refined insights in the neural
markers of memory impairment in T2DM, and a novel framework for similar future
investigations in other neurodegenerative diseases.</div></div>
