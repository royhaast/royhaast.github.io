Development of ultra-high field (UHF) strength (7 Tesla) MRI scanners increases
the possibilities, compared to conventional MRI scanners, to obtain structural
and blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) functional MRI (fMRI) data with an
unprecedented spatial resolution, without compromising data quality or
increasing scanning time. In addition, novel post-processing strategies that
enable analyses of complex and convoluted structures become more and more
available.<br>

<br><span style="font-size: normal; font-weight: bold">Hippocampal
formation (with dr. Ali R. Khan and prof. Stefan Kohler)</span><br> <br>The hippocampal formation (HF) was usually &#8212; due
to its small scale &#8212; characterized as a single homogeneous structure using
MRI, and treated as so. However, due to the developments in neuroimaging
techniques and analyses methods nowadays enable detection of fine-scale features
of the hippocampal formation. As a result, morphological (e.g. cortical
thickness), microstructural (e.g. myelination level), as well as the functional
properties (e.g. functional connectivity) of the different hippocampal subfields
&#8212; the subiculum, CA1 to 4 and dentate gyrus &#8212; can subsequently be
mapped into this unfolded space. By combining these two methodological
developments, it is now possible to study the hippocampal formation in greater
detail under varying conditions (e.g. healthy vs. diseased).<br>

<br>Recent studies have evaluated some of the morphological, microstructural and
functional characteristics within and across subfields, but the origins of the
observed differences remain elusive. Based on regional differences in vascular
density and vulnerabilty for vascular patohlogies, it has been hypothesized that
the degree of vascularization of the hippocampus plays a profound role in the
differentiation of the hippocampal subfields. However, this has not been studied
in vivo yet. Here, I propose to examine the role of the hippocampal formation's
vascularization in the differentiation of its subfields, both at the structural
and functional level.<br>

<br>This project aims to: (1) compare several approaches to measure the
vascularization of the hippocampal formation in vivo and (2) relate the
variation in vascularization to the (micro)structural and functional properties
across the hippocampal subfields. I am using state-of-the-art UHF MRI techniques,
which involves non-invasive measurements of the hippocampal formation's
vascularity (vascular density and perfusion), as well as quantification of
morphological (volume and thickness) and microstructural (tissue relaxometry,
susceptibility and integrity) features. Moreover, I will combine BOLD fMRI with
behavioral data to probe differences in functional connectivity across
subfields.</br>

<br><div id="subproject"> <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8212;
Multi-parametric UHF MRI protocol (in collaboration with dr. Kamil Uludag and dr. Dimo Ivanov)</span><br> <br>I will setup an optimized
multi-parametric UHF MRI protocol using acquisition schemes that capture
fine-scale properties of the hippocampal formation. Here, prime focus will be on
the implementation and optimization of existing vascular imaging methods. These
will include time-of-flight, susceptibility-weighted and arterial spin labeling
imaging. High spatial resolution will be crucial for the proposed experiments,
as the structures of interest are small. Image post-processing methods will be
optimized to (a) preserve the spatial specificity of the resulting artery, vein
and cerebral blood flow (CBF) maps, (b) allow implementation in an in-house
developed hippocampal formation coordinate system4 and (c) be combined with
other parametric maps.</div>

<br><div id="subproject"> <span style="font-weight: bold">&#8212; Probing
subfield integrity</span><br> <br>In healthy humans (N=20), I will obtain and
analyze the multi-parametric UHF MRI data combined with high resolution
resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) and behavioral data. Recent work has shown that
high resolution rs-fMRI imaging allows for assessing connectivity between
hippocampal subfields7. Here, I will validate these findings by disentangling
contributions from neuronal activity and other physiological effects such as
macroscopic vasculature. In addition, behavioral measures to probe distinct
memory subprocesses, such as mismatch detection, pattern separation, and pattern
completion, will be employed to correlate with hippocampal subfield integrity
based on the UHF MRI data.</div>

<br>The hippocampal formation is of vital importance for proper daily life
functioning. It has been linked to episodic memory (i.e., encoding and retrieval
of personal past experiences), as well as to other types of declarative memory1,
and is therefore one of the most studied structures of the brain. Structural
changes of the hippocampal formation, such as reduced volume (i.e. atrophy), are
well-established biomarkers in numerous neurodegenerative diseases linked to
memory loss.<br>
